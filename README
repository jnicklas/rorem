Rorem
=====

Rorem is a random data generator that automatically fill Ruby classes with Random data, here's how:


  class Car
  
    include Rorem::Model
  
    attr_accessor :brand, :seats, :owner_name, :owner_age, :special_car
    
  end
  
  Car.factory do |car|
  
    # all brands are equality likely
    car.brand = random(%w(BMW Mercedes Volvo Jaguar))
    
    # assign probabilities to each value
    car.seats = random([2, 4], :distribution => [0.2, 0.8])
    
    # use a normal distribution to describe probabilities
    car.owner_age = random(18..70, :distribution => normal(40, 15))
    
    # generate a name from rorem's database of names
    car.owner_name = random(:name
    
    # a deterministic value can be set
    car.special_car false
  
  end
  
  c = Car.new
  
  c.fill
  
  c.brand #=> 'BMW'
  c.seats #=> 4
  c.owner_age #=> 27
  c.owner_name #=> 'Allan Hernandez'
  c.special_car #=> false
  
another (more complex) example

  class Employee
  
    include Rorem::Model
    
    attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name, :email, :employee_nr, :empolyee_id, :address, :city, :country
  
  end
  
  Employee.factory do
  
    c.employee_nr = sequence(:employee_nr, :start => 1)
  
    person = random(:person, :unique => true)
    location = random(:location)
  
    c.first_name = person.first_name
    c.last_name = person.last_name
    c.email = person.email
    c.address = location.address
    c.city = location.city
    c.country = location.country
    
    c.employee_id = c.first_name[1..3] + c.last_name[1..4] + c.employee_nr.to_s
    
  
  
  end
